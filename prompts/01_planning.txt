we are going to build a game where the objective of each level is to clear all of the bricks in the level.

there is an intro screen with a "START" button, when the player clicks the "START" button, the game starts.

eventually the player will be able to select a difficulty level, and progress through multiple game levels.

a game over screen will be displayed when the player's health reaches 0 which also allows the player to restart

the style for this game is dystopian with bright neon colours

the game will have the following features:
- fullscreen window
- a "bat" that can be moved left and right either with a keyboard or mouse control
- a "ball" that bounces off the bat and bricks
- the bricks have individual health and can be destroyed by the ball
- there is a wall behind the ball and when the ball hits the wall, the health of the player decreases
- when the player's health reaches 0, the game is over
- when all bricks are destroyed, the player wins the level
- the game has multiple levels
- at the end of each level, the player can choose between different upgrades
- the angle of the ball when it bounces off the bat should be based on where it hits the bat - the further from the center, the steeper the angle
- later in the game, multiple balls could spawn


for the initial planning, focus on the above with the following rules for level one:
- each brick has a health of 1, the player wall has a health of 3
- the ball has a speed of 1
- the bat has a width of 100 and a height of 10
- the bat is centered towards the bottom of the screen
- the bricks form the word "BRICKS" on the screen

make sure that the rules for level one are configuration only and that the main game engine is doing all of the work.

let's start by writing the README.md, architecture.md and planning.md files, remembering to ask questions instead of making assumptions.

the planning.md file should be written as a sequence of prompts that will guide you through developing the game iteratively
