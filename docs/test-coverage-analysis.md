## Testing Strategy Recommendations

### 1. **Mock Strategy**
- Use Jest's mock functions for callbacks
- Mock canvas context for rendering tests
- Mock electron API for persistence tests
- Use fake timers for time-based tests

### 2. **Test Organization**
- Group tests by functionality (initialization, update, render, collision)
- Use descriptive test names following "should..." pattern
- Test edge cases and boundary conditions
- Test error handling paths

### 3. **Coverage Goals**
- **Critical components** (collision, input): Target 90%+ coverage
- **Game entities**: Target 80%+ coverage
- **Managers**: Target 75%+ coverage
- **UI components**: Can remain lower priority

### 4. **Integration Tests**
Consider adding integration tests for:
- Complete collision detection flow
- Game state transitions
- Level progression
- Upgrade application

### 5. **Performance Tests**
Consider adding performance tests for:
- Collision detection with many entities
- Particle system with many particles
- Rendering with complex scenes
