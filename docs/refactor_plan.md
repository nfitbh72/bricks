# Refactoring Plan: Modularizing the Game Architecture

This document outlines the step-by-step plan to refactor the game architecture, addressing the "God Object" anti-pattern in `Game.ts` and improving overall modularity.

## Executive Summary

**Status**: 5 of 6 phases complete (83% complete)  
**Progress**: ✅✅✅✅✅⬜  
**God Object Anti-Pattern**: **Successfully Addressed** ✅

The refactoring has transformed `Game.ts` from a monolithic "God Object" (~2000+ lines, 30+ responsibilities) into a lean coordinator (1068 lines, 5 core responsibilities) that delegates to 15 specialized managers. The architecture now follows SOLID principles with clear separation of concerns, event-driven communication, and testable components.

**Completed Phases**:
- ✅ Phase 1: Core Architecture (GameLoop, EventManager, GameContext)
- ✅ Phase 2: Entity Management (IEntity interface, unified lists)
- ✅ Phase 3: Rendering Separation (RenderManager)
- ✅ Phase 4: Collision System (Spatial hash, generic handlers)
- ✅ Phase 5: Level & Factory Logic (pure data objects)

**Remaining Work**:
- ⬜ Phase 6: Screen Management (dependency injection, lazy loading)

---

## Phase 1: Core Architecture & The "God Object" ✅ COMPLETE
**Goal**: Decompose `Game.ts` into smaller, focused responsibilities.

### Step 1.1: Extract GameLoop ✅
- **Action**: Create a `GameLoop` class in `src/renderer/game/core/GameLoop.ts`.
- **Status**: COMPLETE
- **Responsibility**: Handle `requestAnimationFrame`, `deltaTime` calculation, and the fixed timestep loop.

### Step 1.2: Event Bus Pattern ✅
- **Action**: Create `EventManager` in `src/renderer/game/core/EventManager.ts`.
- **Status**: COMPLETE
- **Responsibility**: Centralized event handling to decouple systems.

### Step 1.3: GameContext / Service Locator ✅
- **Action**: Create `GameContext` in `src/renderer/game/core/GameContext.ts`.
- **Status**: COMPLETE
- **Responsibility**: Specific container for shared dependencies.

## Phase 2: Entity Management ✅ COMPLETE
**Goal**: Unify entity handling to support easier extensibility.

### Step 2.1: Unified Entity Interface ✅
- **Action**: Define `IEntity` interface.
- **Status**: COMPLETE
- **Changes**:
    - Created `IEntity` interface with `update()`, `render()`, `getBounds()`, `isActive()`, `deactivate()`
    - Created `Bounds` type for collision detection
    - Updated 5 entities to implement `IEntity`: `FallingBrick`, `Debris`, `BrickLaser`, `SplittingFragment`, `DynamiteStick`
    - Created `HomingMissileWrapper` for `HomingMissile` (special update signature)
    - Fixed `CollisionManager` null checks for `getBounds()` returning `Bounds | null`

### Step 2.2: Single List Management ✅
- **Action**: Refactor `OffensiveEntityManager` to use a single `List<IEntity>`.
- **Status**: COMPLETE
- **Changes**:
    - Replaced 6 separate arrays with single `entities: IEntity[]`
    - Kept `homingMissileWrappers` array for special handling
    - Simplified update/render loops to single iterations
    - Type-specific getters use `filter()` to return typed views
    - Reduced code duplication significantly

### Step 2.3: Factory Pattern ✅
- **Action**: Create `OffensiveEntityFactory`.
- **Status**: COMPLETE (factory pattern already in use)
- **Changes**:
    - `OffensiveEntityManager.spawnOffensiveEntity()` acts as factory method
    - Returns unified `IEntity[]` for consistent handling
    - Encapsulates entity creation logic based on brick type

## Phase 3: Separation of Rendering & Logic ✅ COMPLETE (Step 3.1)
**Goal**: Decouple game logic from the DOM/Canvas.

### Step 3.1: Render System ✅
- **Action**: Consolidate all rendering in `RenderManager`.
- **Status**: COMPLETE
- **Changes**:
    - Added `boss` and `bossCopies` parameters to `RenderManager.renderGameplay()`
    - Moved boss rendering logic from `Game.ts` to `RenderManager`
    - All rendering now goes through `RenderManager`
    - `Game.ts` no longer has direct rendering calls

### Step 3.2: View/Model Separation (DEFERRED)
- **Action**: Separate logic classes from rendering.
- **Status**: DEFERRED - This is a much larger refactor
- **Changes**:
    - Would require creating separate renderer classes for each entity type
    - Would need to extract visual state from entity logic
    - Significant changes to entity architecture
- **Recommendation**: Defer until there's a clear need

## Phase 4: Collision System ✅ COMPLETE
**Goal**: Optimize and generalize collision detection.

### Step 4.1: Spatial Partitioning ✅
- **Action**: Implement a QuadTree or Spatial Hash.
- **Status**: COMPLETE
- **Changes**:
    - Implemented `SpatialHash` in `src/renderer/game/core/SpatialHash.ts`
    - Integrated into `CollisionManager.populateSpatialHash()` and `checkBallBrickCollisions()`
    - Reduced collision checks from O(N^2) to O(N) for ball-brick collisions

### Step 4.2: Generic Collision Handlers ✅
- **Action**: Define collision groups and generic handlers.
- **Status**: COMPLETE
- **Changes**:
    - Created `ICollidable` interface with `getCollisionGroup()` and `getBounds()`
    - Created `CollisionGroup` enum (BALL, BAT, BRICK, LASER, BOMB, OFFENSIVE)
    - Created `CollisionHandlerRegistry` to centralize collision logic
    - Implemented generic `CollisionManager.processCollisions()` with handler registry
    - Registered handlers: BOMB vs BRICK, LASER vs BRICK, BAT vs OFFENSIVE
    - Note: Ball-brick and ball-bat collisions still use specialized methods due to complex physics

## Phase 5: Level & Factory Logic ✅ COMPLETE
**Goal**: Make `Level` a pure data object.

### Step 5.1: Level Factory ✅
- **Action**: Create `LevelBuilder` or `LevelFactory` (enhance existing).
- **Changes**:
    - ✅ Move parsing and layout logic out of `Level.ts`.
    - ✅ `LevelFactory` handles all brick creation, centering, and layout

### Step 5.2: Pure Data Level ✅
- **Action**: Refactor `Level.ts`.
- **Changes**:
    - ✅ `Level` only holds the list of bricks and current state
    - ✅ Removed `render()` method - moved to `RenderManager`
    - ✅ Removed `reset()` method - bricks handle their own restoration
    - ✅ `Level` is now a pure data container (83 lines)

## Phase 6: Screen Management
**Goal**: Improve screen lifecycle management.

### Step 6.1: Dependency Injection
- **Action**: Pass dependencies to `ScreenManager` or Screens via `GameContext`.
- **Changes**:
    - Remove `setAchievementTracker` style methods.

### Step 6.2: Lazy Instantiation
- **Action**: Instantiate screens only when needed.
- **Changes**:
    - Reduce initial load time and memory usage.

## Analysis: Addressing the "God Object" Anti-Pattern

### Current Status: **SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS** ✅

The refactoring effort has successfully addressed the "God Object" anti-pattern in `Game.ts` through systematic decomposition and delegation. Here's the analysis:

### What Was the Problem?

The original `Game.ts` was a classic "God Object" - a single class responsible for:
- Game loop management
- Rendering all entities
- Collision detection and handling
- Input processing
- Audio playback
- Screen/UI management
- State transitions
- Entity lifecycle management
- Visual effects
- Weapon systems
- Achievement tracking

This violated the **Single Responsibility Principle** and made the codebase difficult to maintain, test, and extend.

### What We've Achieved

#### ✅ **Extracted Core Systems** (Phase 1)
1. **GameLoop** - Handles `requestAnimationFrame`, delta time, and fixed timestep
2. **EventManager** - Centralized event bus for decoupled communication
3. **GameContext** - Service locator for shared dependencies

**Impact**: Game loop logic removed from `Game.ts`, event-driven architecture established

#### ✅ **Delegated to Specialized Managers** (Phases 2-4)
The `Game` class now delegates to 12 focused managers:

| Manager | Responsibility | Lines of Code |
|---------|---------------|---------------|
| `AudioManager` | Sound effects and music | ~140 |
| `InputManager` | Keyboard/mouse input | ~150 |
| `ScreenManager` | UI screens and transitions | ~330 |
| `EffectsManager` | Particles, screen shake, damage numbers | ~310 |
| `CollisionManager` | Collision detection with spatial hash | 663 |
| `WeaponManager` | Lasers, bombs, delayed explosions | 257 |
| `OffensiveEntityManager` | Enemy entities (unified list) | ~170 |
| `SlowMotionManager` | Time dilation effects | ~205 |
| `StateTransitionHandler` | Game state transitions | ~315 |
| `RenderManager` | All rendering logic | ~180 |
| `AchievementTracker` | Achievement progress | 331 |
| `CollisionHandlerRegistry` | Collision behavior registration | ~225 |
| `BossManager` | Boss spawning, updates, collisions | 333 |
| `BallManager` | Ball spawning, removal, lifecycle | 193 |
| `LevelInitializer` | Level setup and initialization | 178 |

**Impact**: `Game.ts` reduced from ~2000+ lines to 1068 lines, with clear delegation patterns

#### ✅ **Unified Entity Management** (Phase 2)
- Created `IEntity` interface for common entity operations
- Consolidated 6 separate arrays into single `entities: IEntity[]` in `OffensiveEntityManager`
- Eliminated code duplication in update/render loops

**Impact**: Easier to add new entity types, reduced complexity

#### ✅ **Separated Rendering from Logic** (Phase 3)
- All rendering delegated to `RenderManager`
- `Game.ts` no longer has direct canvas drawing calls
- Boss rendering moved from `Game.update()` to `RenderManager.renderGameplay()`

**Impact**: Clear separation of concerns, easier to test game logic

#### ✅ **Optimized Collision System** (Phase 4)
- Implemented spatial hash for O(N) ball-brick collision detection
- Created generic collision handler system with `ICollidable` interface
- Extracted collision logic to `CollisionHandlerRegistry`

**Impact**: Better performance, extensible collision system

### Current State of `Game.ts`

The `Game` class is now a **coordinator** rather than a "God Object". Its responsibilities are:

1. **Initialization** - Create and wire up managers
2. **Coordination** - Orchestrate manager interactions
3. **Game State** - Maintain high-level game state (health, level, balls)
4. **Delegation** - Forward work to appropriate managers

**Key Metrics**:
- **Before**: ~2000+ lines, ~30+ responsibilities
- **After**: 1068 lines, ~5 core responsibilities
- **Manager Count**: 15 specialized managers (including BossManager, BallManager, LevelInitializer)
- **Cyclomatic Complexity**: Significantly reduced
- **Latest Reductions**: 
  - BossManager: 213 lines removed (333 lines in new manager)
  - BallManager: 75 lines removed (193 lines in new manager)
  - LevelInitializer: 54 lines removed (178 lines in new manager)
  - Collision Orchestration: 58 lines removed (83 lines added to CollisionManager)
  - Achievement Progress Comparison: 21 lines removed (38 lines added to AchievementTracker)
  - Delayed Bomb Explosions: 49 lines removed (69 lines added to WeaponManager)

- `Level` reduced from 103 lines to 83 lines (20 lines removed)
- `Level` is now a pure data container with only getters and state queries
- `LevelFactory` handles all creation logic (already in place)
- All tests passing (13 test suites, 106 tests)

### Remaining Concerns

While substantial progress has been made, `Game.ts` is now in excellent shape:

1. **Event Listeners** - `setupEventListeners()` is ~100 lines (lines ~395-500)
   - **Note**: This is acceptable as it's just wiring up event handlers, not business logic
   - This is appropriate for a coordinator class

2. **Minor State Management** - Some game state remains (health, level timer, etc.)
   - **Note**: This is appropriate for the game coordinator to maintain

### Modularity Assessment

**Overall Grade: B+**

**Strengths**:
- ✅ Clear separation of concerns across managers
- ✅ Event-driven architecture reduces coupling
- ✅ Dependency injection via `GameContext`
- ✅ Single Responsibility Principle mostly followed
- ✅ Testable components (managers can be unit tested independently)

**Areas for Improvement**:
- ⚠️ `Game.ts` still coordinates too much collision logic
- ⚠️ Boss and ball management could be further extracted
- ⚠️ Some manager dependencies are tightly coupled (e.g., `ScreenManager` knows about many other managers)

### Conclusion

**Yes, we are successfully addressing the "God Object" anti-pattern.** The refactoring has transformed `Game.ts` from a monolithic class into a lean coordinator that delegates to specialized managers. The architecture is now:

- **More modular** - Clear boundaries between systems
- **More testable** - Managers can be tested in isolation
- **More maintainable** - Changes are localized to specific managers
- **More extensible** - New features can be added without modifying core game loop

The remaining work (Phases 5-6) will further improve modularity, but the core architectural transformation is complete.
